# WhatsApp MCP Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. QR Code Connection Issue ✅
**Problem**: QR code was generated but couldn't connect properly
**Solution**: 
- Updated `deviceManager.js` to use proper Baileys configuration
- Added proper QR code generation with data URL format
- Improved error handling and timeout management
- Added session isolation per user (sessions/{userId}/{deviceId})
- Better browser identification for WhatsApp

### 2. Campaign Creation Error ✅
**Problem**: "Failed to create campaign" due to database constraint
**Solution**: 
- The database has a UNIQUE constraint on (user_id, campaign_date)
- This prevents multiple campaigns per user per date
- Run the SQL fix to remove this constraint:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d whatsapp_mcp -f fixes/fix-campaigns-constraint.sql
```

### 3. Multi-User/Multi-Device Support ✅
**Problem**: Sessions were not properly isolated between users
**Solution**:
- Sessions are now stored in `sessions/{userId}/{deviceId}/`
- Each user's devices are completely isolated
- QR codes are properly tracked per device
- Connection status is managed individually

## Installation Steps:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
```bash
npm install
```

2. **Fix the database constraint**:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d whatsapp_mcp -f fixes/fix-campaigns-constraint.sql
```

3. **Clear old sessions** (optional but recommended):
```bash
rm -rf sessions/*
```

4. **Restart the server**:
```bash
npm start
```

## How to Test:

### 1. Test QR Code Connection:
- Login to the dashboard
- Add a new device or click "QR Code" on existing device
- You should see a proper WhatsApp QR code
- Scan with WhatsApp (Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device)
- The device should connect and show as "online"

### 2. Test Campaign Creation:
- Go to Campaign tab
- Click on any date in the calendar
- Create multiple campaigns for the same date
- They should all save successfully

### 3. Test Multi-User:
- Create another user account
- Login with the new account
- Add devices - they should be completely separate
- Each user only sees their own devices

## Key Changes Made:

### deviceManager.js:
- Added proper Baileys version fetching
- Improved QR code generation with QRCode library
- Added data URL format for QR codes
- Better error handling and connection management
- User-isolated session directories
- Proper timeout handling (2 minutes for QR)

### devices.js routes:
- Enhanced QR code display page with better error messages
- Added connection status feedback
- Added QR code timeout handling
- Added API endpoint for QR status checking

### Campaign constraint:
- Removed UNIQUE constraint to allow multiple campaigns per date
- Added index for performance

## Troubleshooting:

### If QR code doesn't appear:
1. Check server console for errors
2. Make sure port 8080 is not blocked
3. Try refreshing the QR code page
4. Check if sessions directory has write permissions

### If WhatsApp doesn't connect after scanning:
1. Make sure you're using latest WhatsApp version
2. Try logging out the device and reconnecting
3. Check server logs for connection errors
4. Ensure your internet connection is stable

### If campaigns still fail:
1. Verify the database fix was applied
2. Check that you have write permissions on the database
3. Look for any other constraints in the error message

## Architecture Overview:

```
User 1
├── Device 1 (sessions/userId1/deviceId1/)
├── Device 2 (sessions/userId1/deviceId2/)
└── Device 3 (sessions/userId1/deviceId3/)

User 2
├── Device 1 (sessions/userId2/deviceId1/)
└── Device 2 (sessions/userId2/deviceId2/)
```

Each user's devices are completely isolated with their own session storage.
